# MeanCrudApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.14.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Huh?

This is an Angular front-end with a Node backend (and Express API routes), that talks to a MongoDB hosted on Azure in a CosmosDB.
